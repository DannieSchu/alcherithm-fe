# Alcherithm

## Overview
Understanding how to approach code challenges is a major hurdle for aspiring developers. This app makes the process more accessible and interactive. Targeting introductory code challenges in the [Alchemy Code Lab](https://www.alchemycodelab.com) curriculum, Alcherithm provides an integrated testing environment where students can view resources while completing challenges. Metrics presented track students' progress, encouraging continuing effort. Students can easily view their past solutions and even those of their peers.
